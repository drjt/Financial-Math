<section xml:id="BondsIntroduction"><title>Introduction to Bonds</title>
        	<p>A bond is a financial instrument that is often utilized to finance capital needs. Indeed, the lender often utilizes the sale of such
        	an instrument to invest in long-term productivity-increasing items.  Indeed, the bond often requires that the issuer of the bond utilized
        	the bond proceeds for some designated project. In return for the money paid to purchase the bond, the purchaser (bond-holder)
        	if promised the principle back plus interest. The rate of interest charged is often fixed but can also be variable.</p>
        	<p>Some terms:
        	<ul>
				<li>Maturity Value = Promised repayment future value</li>
				<li>Coupon = Percentage of annual interest paid during the time span of the bond.</li>
				<li>Price = Present Value of the Bond's Maturity Value</li>
				<li>Yield = Total Interest Earned</li>
				<li>Par Bonds = An instrument in which yield equals coupon.</li>
				<li>Discount Bonds = An instrument in which the yield is greater than the coupon.</li>
				<li>Premium Bonds = An instrument in which the yield is less than the coupon.</li>
				<li>Capital Appreciation Bonds = An instrument which pays no interest until maturity.</li>
				<li>Callable Bonds = An instrument which can be redeemed by the issuer before the actual maturity date.</li>
				<li>Basis Point = one hundredth of one percent yield.</li>
				
        	</ul>
        	</p>
    

        	<p>Price and Yield vary in opposite directions. As the price of a bond increases, the difference between price and maturity value 
        	diminishes and therefore yield goes down. As the price decreases, the difference increases and therefore yield goes up.</p>
        	<p>Fixed rate bonds generally presume a 360-day year. Variable rate bonds presume actual days elapsed.</p>

<section><title>Bond Yield</title>
        	
        	<p>The bond yield, which is a measure of the income generated by a bond, is calculated as the interest divided by the 
        	price. Therefore, if a <m>\$ 10,000</m> bond with 10% annual Coupons (probably broken up into two semi-annual payments of
        	<m>\$ 500</m> each) is selling at <m>\$ 10,000 </m>, or par, the coupon payment 
        	is equal to 10%, i.e. the Yield. However bond prices can be affected by market conditions and so may fluctuate. As they do
        	so does the yield. </p>
        	
        	<p>In this example, if the market price fluctuated and valued your bond to be worth <m>\$ 9,000 </m>, your yield would now 
        	be 11.11% (1000/9000), but the <m>\$ 500</m> semi-annual coupon payments would not change. Conversely, if the bond price were to 
        	shoot up to <m>\$ 11000</m>, your yield would decrease to 9.09% (1000/11000), but again, you would still receive the same 
        	<m>\$ 500 </m> semi-annual coupon payments.</p>
        	
        	<example><title>Zero Coupon Bond Purchase Price</title>
        	<p>A bond with no coupons is valued as a normal compound investment with the Maturity Value the specified future value.
        	To compute the purchase price of a 20 year <m>\$ 5000 </m> bond with yearly rate of 4.95%</p>
        	<me>P = \$ 5000 (1+0.0495)^{-20} = \$ 1173.54.</me>
        	</example>
        	
        	<theorem><title> Accumulated Value for Annual Coupon Bond</title>
        	<statement>Total Accumulated Value<m> = P(1 + r_{eff} \cdot t)</m></statement>
				<proof>
					<p>A bond with annual coupons will pay a simple interest coupon each year in the amount of <m>P \cdot r_{eff}</m>,
					 where <m>r_{eff}</m> is the effective annual interest rate.  Since the interest is paid out each year then 
					 there is no
					compounding effect and so the total value including interest of the bond follows a simple interest model with 
					Total Amount Accumulated <me> = P + P \cdot r_{eff} \cdot t = P(1 + r_{eff} \cdot t)</me>.</p>
				</proof>
        	</theorem>

        	<example>
        	<p>Consider a 20 year 9% bond with annual coupons purchased in 1998 for <m>\$ 93000</m>. The amount of each  coupon  
        	is the same <m>\$ 93000 \cdot 0.09 = \$ 8370</m>.  So, by 2012 the accumulated interest would have been 
        	<m>8370 \cdot 14</m> years = <m>\$ 117180</m>.  For the entire length of the bond, the total amount accumulated by 2018
        	would be <m>\$ 93000(1+0.09 \cdot 20) = \$ 260,400 </m>.</p>
        	</example>

				<theorem><title>Setting price of bond with periodic coupons.</title>
				<statement>Given a bond with stated rate of <m>r_{bond}</m>, nominal rate of <m>r_{nom}</m>maturity (face) value of <m>MV</m>, and 
				which matures in t years with coupons provided m times a year, the purchase price is given by
				<me>MV (1+\frac{r_{nom}}{m})^{-n} + MV \cdot \frac{r_{bond}}{m} \cdot \frac{1-(1+\frac{r_{nom}}{m})^{-n}}{\frac{r_{nom}}{m}}</me>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>The yearly coupon value equals <m>MV \cdot r_{bond}</m> 
					broken up into m payments of size <m>R = MV \frac{r_{bond}}{m}</m>.  These coupons can be thought of as a regular 
					annuity with <m>n = m \cdot t</m> payments and finding the present value of these yields the second part of this
					formula.</p>
					<p>The maturity value also is factored into the price by using the compound interest formulas with the nominal rate
					and moving back n periods to the time when the bond is sold. This is the first part of this formula.</p>
				</proof>
				</theorem>
			
				<corollary>
				<statement>For Bonds where bond rate = nominal rate, purchase price equals maturity value</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>In this case, <m>r_{nom} = r_{bond} = r</m> gives</p>

				<p>An issuing company may choose to repurchase a bond before the bond matures and may agree to purchase it back at par value. 
				However, the bond is said to be purchased at a discount if its price is less than its redemption value. On the other hand, it 
				is purchased at a premium if its purchase price is greater than its redemption value. </p>
				<p>To determine the fair value of the bond immediately following a coupon payment, adjust the formula above for determining purchase
				price at the onset of the bond so that it focuses value at one of the time periods in the bonds life span.</p>

<section><title> Current Yield</title>
				<p>The current yield CY is the return (as a percentage) of the annual coupon payment. This yield determines 
				what percentage of the actual dollar coupon payment is of the price the investor pays for the bond.</p>
				<me>CY = \$ 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Annual Interest Paid}}{\text{Market Price}}</me>
				<example>
					<p>Suppose you purchase a bond with par value <m>\$ 5000 </m> for <m>\$ 4950 </m> with a coupon rate of 4%.  Then, it's current yield:</p>
					<me>CY = \$ 100 \cdot \frac{5000 \cdot 0.04}{4950} = 4.0404</me>
				</example>
				<p>The computation above does not include any possible gains or losses if the bond were bought at a discount or premium. 
				Since the comparison of the bond price to its par value is a factor that affects the actual current yield, unless the
				purchaser pays par value for the bond then the above formula would give a slightly inaccurate picture. To correct this, 
				investors can modify the current yield formula by adding the result of the current yield to the gain or loss the price 
				gives the investor: [(Par Value – Bond Price)/Years to Maturity]. 
				The modified current yield formula then takes into account the discount or premium at which the investor bought the bond: </p>
				<me>CY = \$ 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Annual Coupon}}{\text{Market Price}} + 
				          \frac{\text{Maturity Value - Market Price}}{\text{Years Till Maturity}}</me>

				<example>
					<p>Suppose our bond above matures in 60 months and has a coupon payment of <m>\$ 10 </m>.  Then</p>
					<me>CY = \$ 10 \cdot \frac{10}{4950} + \frac{5000-4950}{5} = 10.2020</me>
					<p>The adjusted current yield of 10.20% is higher than the current yield of 4.04% because the bond's discounted price 
					(4950 instead of 5000) gives the investor more of a gain on the investment</p>

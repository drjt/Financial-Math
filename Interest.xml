<section xml:id="SimpleInterest"><title>Simple Interest</title>

<p>
To determine the amount of interest one should pay for the use of someone else's money, one model is to base the amount of interest according to two conditions:
<ul>
<li>interest should be directly proportional to the length of time over which the money is lent</li>
<li>interest should be directly proportional to some rate which is based upon the borrower's perceived ability to repay and based upon current market conditions.</li>
</ul>
Often, when dealing with monetary value over time one can more easily illustrate the setting using a time line
<me>
\begin{matrix}
 \text{Money Amounts} &amp; P &amp;  \rightarrow &amp; A \\ 
  \hline \\
  \text{Time} &amp;  0  &amp; \rightarrow &amp;  t 
\end{matrix}					
</me>
</p>

<p>				
To satisfy these constraints leads to the model for Simple Interest.

<theorem xml:id="SimpleInterestFormula"><title>Simple Interest Formula</title>
<statement>Using simple interest, <m>I = P \cdot i \cdot t</m> and so <m>A = P + P \cdot i \cdot t</m> or <m>A = P(1 + i \cdot t)</m></statement>

<section xml:id="CompoundInterest"><title>Regular Compound Interest</title>

<p>
When using simple interest, one only considers the value of the resource at the beginning of time and then again at the end. H
owever, the lender does without use of the funds at all times during the period of the investment. Indeed, if the original investment
were to only be lent for 1/2 of the original time period, then the borrower would have to pay the accrued interest at that time (1/2 as much
as planned) and then perhaps re-borrow the money plus the paid interest for the remaining time. However, for the second half, the amount borrowed
would include the additional interest that had to be paid.  Continuing this by shortening the period (say, 1/4's or 1/12's) would allow
for the amount borrowed at the end of each period to grow. The net effect of this recalculation over many periods gives rise to what is 
know as Compound Interest.</p>

<theorem xml:id="CompoundInterestV"><title>Future Value of Compound Interest</title>
<statement>
	<p>Using Compound interest over t years, compounding m times per year, yields 
	<m>\displaystyle A = P(1+r)^n</m> with <m>n=mt</m> and <m>r = i/m</m></p>
</statement>
<proof>
	<p>To determine the future value of a deposit of size <m>P</m> over several 
	periods, utilize the <xref ref="SimpleInterestFormula">simple interest formula</xref> for a single
	period to determine the value of the deposit after that one period. Then, 
	take that new (slightly larger) amount as a starting point
	for a new simple interest calculation covering the next period. Repeat 
	for n periods to get the ending value over all periods.</p>
	<p>To do this, let's denote the present value after k periods as 
	<m>P_k</m> and note that <m>P_0 = P</m>.</p>
	<me>
	\begin{matrix}
	\text{Money Amounts} &amp; P_0 &amp; P_1 &amp; P_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; P_n \\ 
  	\hline \\
	\text{Time} &amp;  0  &amp; \frac{t}{n} &amp; \frac{2t}{n} &amp; \ldots &amp; t \\ 
	\end{matrix}					
	</me>
	
	<p>Then, using simple interest over each single time period</p>
	<md>
		<mrow>P_1 &amp; = P_0(1+r)</mrow>
		<mrow>P_2 &amp; = P_1(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^2 </mrow>
		<mrow>P_3 &amp; = P_2(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^3</mrow>
		<mrow>P_4 &amp; = P_3(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^4</mrow>
		<mrow> &amp; =  ...</mrow>
		<mrow>P_{n-1} &amp; = P_{n-2}(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^{n-1}</mrow>
		<mrow>P_n &amp; = P_{n-1}(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^n</mrow>
	</md>
	
	<p>Noting that <m>A = P_n </m> and <m>P = P_0 </m> gives</p>
	<md>
		<mrow>A &amp; = P(1+r)^n</mrow>
	</md>
</proof>
</theorem>
				
<corollary><title>Present Value of Compound Interest</title>
<statement>Given a future value <m>A</m>, the present value using Compound Interest is given by <m>\displaystyle P = A(1+r)^{-n}</m></statement>
<proof><p>Take the formula above and solve for P. This gives,</p>
	<p><m>\displaystyle P = A(1+r)^{-n}</m></p>
</proof>
</corollary>
				

<definition xml:id="EffectiveInterestRate"><title>Effective Interest Rates</title>
	<p>
	The published yearly interest rate is also called the "nominal" rate.
	As one considers investments (and especially annuities) one may desire compounding the value of money over different compounding time 
	frames. So, comparing raw interest rates becomes muddled since the same nominal rate can result in wildly different actual growth amounts.
	To avoid confusion we determine what is known as an effective interest rate
	by computing the increase of <m>\$ 1</m> over one year's time span. This results in the effective rate <m>r_e</m>
	<md>
		<mrow>P + I = 1 + 1 \cdot r_e \cdot 1 = 1(1+r)^m</mrow>
		<mrow>r_e = (1+r)^m - 1</mrow>
	</md>
	</p>
</definition>

<example><title>Comparing different compounding periods</title>
	<p>Determine the effective rate of compounding daily that is equivalent to compounding monthly at an annual rate of <m>r_{12}=4%</m>.  
	To do so, first compute the effective interest rate of the monthly compounding (since you know its stated rate) using 
	<m> \displaystyle (1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} - 1</m>.  Then, use the effective rate
	formula set equal to this effective value and work your way backward to find the annual rate <m>r_{365}</m>for compounding daily.</p>
	<md>
		<mrow>(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} - 1 &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365})^{365} - 1 </mrow>
		<mrow>(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365})^{365} </mrow>
		<mrow>\ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365})^{365} </mrow>
		<mrow>12 \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12}) &amp; = 365 \ln(1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365}) </mrow>
		<mrow>\frac{12}{365} \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12}) &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365}) </mrow>
		<mrow>e^{\frac{12}{365} \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})} &amp; = 1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365} </mrow>
		<mrow>365(e^{\frac{12}{365} \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})} - 1) &amp; = r_{365} </mrow>
	</md>
	
	<p>and the rest is arithmetic.  Easily, the above example generalizes to other compounding periods:</p>
	<md>
		<mrow>(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})^{m_1} - 1 &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2})^{m_2} - 1 </mrow>
		<mrow>(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})^{m_1} &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2})^{m_2} </mrow>
		<mrow>\ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})^{m_1} &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2})^{m_2} </mrow>
		<mrow>m_1 \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1}) &amp; = m_2 \ln(1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2}) </mrow>
		<mrow>\frac{m_1}{m_2} \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1}) &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2}) </mrow>
		<mrow>e^{\frac{m_1}{m_2} \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})} &amp; = 1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2} </mrow>
		<mrow>m_2(e^{\frac{m_1}{m_2} \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})} - 1) &amp; = r_2 </mrow>
	</md>
</example>

<section xml:id="ContinuousCompounting"><title>Continuous Compounding of Interest</title>

<p>As interest is compounded more often, the effective interest rate tends to increase. Indeed, as m increases then the time between
periods decreases and becomes infinitesimal.  We would then say that interest is compounded continuously. As it turns out, we will 
see that there is a limit to the effective rate as m grows.</p>
